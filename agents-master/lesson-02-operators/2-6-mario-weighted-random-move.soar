##### NOTE:
# These preference rules add particular "numeric-indifferent" preferences (or "utility") to each of the movement operators defined in previous files.
# (These rules only fire if the corresponding operators have already been proposed by other rules.)
# When multiple "numeric-indifferent" operators are proposed and competing (that is, there is not a clear best choice due to other preferences like "best" or "worst"), 
#    then Soar's decision making algorithm will select from among them probabilistically according to the numeric utility values. (Higher value means more likely to be selected.)
# Play with the particular numbers below and see how it changes Mario's behavior!
